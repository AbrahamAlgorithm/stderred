This tool wraps another program (the original request was to wrap a Java program) and makes all output to standard error ("stderr") red.  Therefore the tool is called "stderred."

HOW TO USE IT

First, compile it.  Just run:

	$ make

Then use it.  For example, compile the given Java test program:

	$ javac test.java

Then run it with regular Java:

	$ java test

You'll see nothing is red.  Then run it with "stderred":

	$ LD_PRELOAD=./stderred.so java test

Ta-da!  stderr is colorized red!

BONUS FEATURES

You can configure which color it uses by adjusting the #define STDERR_COLOR.

WANT MORE?

I wrapped more C functions than just write() (which seems to be all Sun's JRE uses), but by no means all of them, and you can see that work in my git branches.  I ran into some issue I couldn't figure out with error() so I just abruptly stopped.  If you wanted to go bonkers, you could get the glibc source, put in a patch like what my custom write() does, recompile it, and LD_PRELOAD your entire new glibc before the program.
